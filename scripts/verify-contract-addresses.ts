/**
 * Verifies that every vault contract address recorded in this repo actually
 * has on-chain bytecode matching the vault contract built from this repo's
 * own source, and that CONTRACT_ADDRESSES and KNOWN_POOLS agree with each
 * other on the vault address.
 *
 * This exists to catch a specific supply-chain risk: a PR can submit clean,
 * reviewable source while pointing a contract address at different,
 * unreviewed bytecode the contributor deployed themselves. Reviewing the
 * source diff alone cannot catch that; this script rebuilds the source and
 * compares its hash against what is actually live on-chain.
 *
 * Only the vault contract is checked, since it's the only contract whose
 * address is currently tracked in these two files and whose source lives in
 * this repo. Third-party contracts (Blend's pool, DeFindex's factory/vault,
 * the USDC/EURC issuers) can't be verified this way, since nobody here
 * controls their source.
