# ADMIN is the address that becomes the deployed vault's permanent admin
# (set_admin, set_paused, set_adapter). Deliberately independent of DEPLOYER
# so the deploying key can be thrown away after the run. Defaults to
# DEPLOYER's own address for local/dev convenience, but should always be
# explicitly set to a durable key (or multisig) for anything beyond a
# throwaway testnet run, and MUST be set explicitly ahead of any mainnet
# deployment. Public key only (G...), not a secret key.

# ADMIN_KEY is the signing key (a Stellar secret key, or a `stellar keys`
# alias) for the ADMIN address above. Optional, and only meaningful when ADMIN
# is a separate address from DEPLOYER. initialize() calls
# admin.require_auth(), so that call has to carry ADMIN's own signature, which
# DEPLOYER cannot produce. When ADMIN_KEY is supplied the script signs and
# submits initialize() itself, in the same run as the deploy.
#
# Supply it whenever the key is available on the machine running this script.
# initialize() is callable by ANY address (it only checks that whatever admin
# it is handed authorizes the call), so a deployed-but-uninitialized vault can
# be claimed by whoever calls initialize() first, with themselves as admin.
# Leaving ADMIN_KEY unset means the script cannot close that window itself and
# has to hand the call off, so the window stays open until the key holder runs
# it. See the warning the script prints in that case.
