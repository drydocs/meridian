// Scheduled keeper for #469: periodically compares live rates across the
// protocols a Meridian vault's adapters can target, and calls the vault's
// existing migrate_adapter when a candidate clears a configured minimum
// improvement. migrate_adapter already moves the vault's entire position in
// one slippage-bounded transaction and never touches individual depositor
// balances, so triggering it automatically needs no new authorization
// primitive; see apps/docs/operations/migration-keeper.md for the full
// trust model this keeper's signing key carries.
//
// Rate comparison is pluggable (see RateSourceFn below): neither adapter
// contract exposes a ready-made comparable rate today, so the default
// source (see rate-sources.ts) computes one for each protocol out of what
// the on-chain data actually provides. This mirrors the accrual keeper's
// own shape (discovery, retry, structured failure reporting, deadline
// budget); see accrual-keeper.ts.
