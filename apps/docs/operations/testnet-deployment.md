# Testnet Deployment

Meridian ships two deploy scripts, both in `scripts/`. Which one you need depends on what you're doing:

| Script                              | Use when                                                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `scripts/deploy-testnet.sh`         | Standing up a brand new environment: vault, a `BlendAdapter`, and an mUSDC share token, all initialized and wired together.                               |
| `scripts/redeploy-blend-adapter.sh` | Pushing new adapter code (e.g. a fix to `accrue()`, `get_pool()`, `get_protocol()`) onto an **already-live** vault, without redeploying the vault itself. |

Neither script requires manual `stellar contract invoke` steps — read them before running if you want to understand exactly what they do; they're short and heavily commented.

## Prerequisites

- Stellar CLI: `cargo install stellar-cli` (the CLI binary is `stellar`, not `soroban` — the older `soroban-cli` is deprecated)
- Rust with the `wasm32v1-none` target: `rustup target add wasm32v1-none`. Note `stellar contract build` targets `wasm32v1-none`, not `wasm32-unknown-unknown` — if you've followed older Soroban tutorials, this is the one place that trips people up.

## The `DEPLOYER` / `ADMIN` split

Both scripts require a `DEPLOYER` secret key, funded via [Friendbot](https://friendbot.stellar.org/). `DEPLOYER` only pays transaction fees and signs the setup calls — it does **not** need to be kept around afterward, and can be thrown away once the script finishes.

`deploy-testnet.sh` additionally accepts an optional `ADMIN` **public key**. This becomes the deployed vault's permanent admin, the only address that can ever call `set_admin`, `set_paused`, `set_adapter`, or `migrate_adapter` on it. `ADMIN` is deliberately independent of `DEPLOYER` as an identity — but not as a _signer_: the vault's `initialize()` calls `admin.require_auth()`, so the deployed-with-`ADMIN`-set-separately case still needs a signature from `ADMIN` itself, not just from `DEPLOYER`. So when `ADMIN` differs from `DEPLOYER`, pass the `ADMIN` signing key as `ADMIN_KEY` (a secret key, or a `stellar keys` alias) alongside it, and the script signs and submits `initialize()` itself in the same run. `ADMIN_KEY` is validated up front: if it resolves to an address other than `ADMIN`, the script exits before building anything. If you don't set `ADMIN`, the script defaults it to `DEPLOYER`'s own address and prints a warning — fine for a quick throwaway test (and the one case where the script _can_ fully automate `initialize()`, since `DEPLOYER`'s own signature already covers it), but you should always set `ADMIN` explicitly to a separate, durable key for anything you intend to keep testing against, and it **must** be set explicitly ahead of any mainnet deployment.

**Set `ADMIN_KEY` whenever the key is on the machine running the script.** `initialize()` is callable by any address and only checks that the admin it is handed authorizes the call, so a vault that is deployed but not yet initialized can be claimed by whoever calls `initialize()` first, with themselves as admin. They would then control `set_admin`, `set_paused`, and `set_adapter` on it, and the real `ADMIN`'s later call would fail with `AlreadyInitialized`. If `ADMIN_KEY` is genuinely not available where the script runs, it falls back to printing the `initialize()` command for the key holder to run, and warns that the vault is claimable until they do. Run it immediately in that case, then confirm the vault is yours with `get_admin` before funding it.

Save the `ADMIN` secret key somewhere durable (a password manager, not a plaintext file) the moment you deploy with it — there is no recovery path if it's lost. `set_admin`/`set_paused`/`set_adapter` become permanently inaccessible, and since adapters have no in-place upgrade path, that also means the vault can never be pointed at fixed adapter code again.

## Standing up a fresh environment

```bash
# Generate and fund a throwaway deployer key
stellar keys generate my-deployer --fund --network testnet
DEPLOYER_ADDR=$(stellar keys address my-deployer)

# Generate and fund a separate, durable admin key (keep this one)
stellar keys generate my-admin --fund --network testnet
ADMIN_ADDR=$(stellar keys address my-admin)

# ADMIN_KEY lets the script sign initialize() in the same run, so the vault is
# never left deployed-but-uninitialized and claimable by a third party.
DEPLOYER=my-deployer ADMIN=$ADMIN_ADDR ADMIN_KEY=my-admin bash scripts/deploy-testnet.sh
```

This builds all three contract crates (`vault`, `blend-adapter`, `defindex-adapter`), uploads and deploys the vault and a `BlendAdapter`, deploys a fresh mUSDC Stellar Asset Contract, and wires everything together:

1. Initializes the `BlendAdapter` with the vault address, Blend's testnet pool, and USDC.
2. Initializes the vault with `admin`, `usdc`, `musdc`, and `adapter` (the just-deployed `BlendAdapter`), signed by `DEPLOYER` when `ADMIN` defaulted to it, or by `ADMIN_KEY` when `ADMIN` is a separate address. Without `ADMIN_KEY` this step is printed for the `ADMIN` key holder to run instead, leaving the vault claimable until they do (see "The `DEPLOYER` / `ADMIN` split" above).
3. Sets the vault as mUSDC's admin, so it can mint/burn shares autonomously.

It prints the three contract IDs you need at the end:

```text
VAULT_CONTRACT_ID=...
BLEND_ADAPTER_CONTRACT_ID=...
MUSDC_CONTRACT_ID=...
```

USDC and the Blend pool address default to the existing testnet contracts (`USDC_ID`, `BLEND_POOL_ID` env vars override them if you need to point somewhere else).

## Updating the app to use the new deployment

The frontend and API discover the vault and mUSDC contract addresses from two places — both need updating:

```typescript
// packages/stellar-sdk-helpers/src/known-pools.ts
KNOWN_POOLS.testnet["meridian-usdc"].contractId = "..."; // VAULT_CONTRACT_ID

// packages/shared/src/constants.ts
CONTRACT_ADDRESSES.testnet.vault = "..."; // VAULT_CONTRACT_ID
CONTRACT_ADDRESSES.testnet.musdc = "..."; // MUSDC_CONTRACT_ID
```

The adapter contract address is **not** hardcoded anywhere in the app — the frontend discovers the active adapter live via `vault.get_adapter()`, and that adapter's `get_pool()`/`get_protocol()`, rather than tracking it in config. This is deliberate: it means the app self-updates if the adapter is ever swapped via `set_adapter` or `migrate_adapter`, with nothing that could drift out of sync.

## Verifying the deployment

```bash
stellar contract invoke --network testnet --source my-deployer \
  --id $VAULT_CONTRACT_ID -- get_total_assets
```

`0` confirms the contract is initialized and responding (a fresh vault has no deposits yet). You can also confirm the full adapter chain resolves correctly:

```bash
stellar contract invoke --network testnet --source my-deployer \
  --id $VAULT_CONTRACT_ID -- get_adapter
# -> BLEND_ADAPTER_CONTRACT_ID

stellar contract invoke --network testnet --source my-deployer \
  --id $BLEND_ADAPTER_CONTRACT_ID -- get_pool
# -> the Blend pool address

stellar contract invoke --network testnet --source my-deployer \
  --id $BLEND_ADAPTER_CONTRACT_ID -- get_protocol
# -> "blend"
```

This is exactly the call chain the frontend uses to discover live APY (`vault.get_adapter()` → `adapter.get_pool()`/`get_protocol()`). If any of these calls fail with `HostError: Error(WasmVm, MissingValue)`, the deployed contract predates the functions you're calling — you're pointed at a stale vault, not this one.

## Pushing new adapter code to a live vault

Adapter contracts have no in-place upgrade path. To get new adapter code (a bug fix, a new feature) onto an already-live vault, deploy a fresh adapter and swap the vault onto it:

```bash
VAULT_ID=$VAULT_CONTRACT_ID DEPLOYER=my-deployer bash scripts/redeploy-blend-adapter.sh
```

This builds and deploys a new `BlendAdapter`, initializes it against the same vault/pool/USDC, and then **prints, but does not run**, the final `set_adapter` command:

```bash
stellar contract invoke --network testnet --source $ADMIN \
  --id $VAULT_ID -- set_adapter --new-adapter $NEW_ADAPTER_ID
```

This last step is deliberately manual. `set_adapter` resets the vault's adapter-share accounting to zero — if any funds are currently deposited through the vault's _current_ adapter, they become unreachable through the vault's normal withdraw flow the moment you swap. Before running the printed command:

1. Confirm no funds are at risk: `vault.get_adapter()` → that adapter's `total_assets()`. If it's non-zero, withdraw first.
2. Run the printed command using the vault's actual `ADMIN` key, not `DEPLOYER` — this call requires `admin.require_auth()`.

## Getting testnet USDC

Blend's testnet pool uses USDC issued by Blend's own controlled test key, not Circle's testnet USDC — the two are different Stellar assets that happen to share an asset code. Fund a testnet wallet from [Blend's public faucet](https://testnet.blend.capital) or via its API endpoint (`fundFromBlendFaucet()` in `apps/web/src/hooks/useVaultActions.ts` calls this automatically when a depositing wallet has no USDC balance). In practice the default faucet call reliably grants BLND/wETH/wBTC but has not reliably granted USDC in testing — if a deposit fails with a missing-trustline or insufficient-balance error, you may need to fund the wallet directly through Blend's own faucet UI.

## Vault migration history

Adapter and vault contracts have no in-place upgrade path (see "Pushing new adapter code to a live vault" above for adapters; the vault itself is the same story). Shipping a vault-level change — new functionality, a bugfix — means a full cutover: deploy a new vault (+ new mUSDC), point `CONTRACT_ADDRESSES`/`KNOWN_POOLS` at it, and leave the old vault contract running, untouched, but unreachable through the app/docs from then on. This section is the durable record of each cutover: what the old address was, why it was superseded, and whether it still holds anything.

### 2026-08-20 — redeployed for `migrate_adapter` (#514)

The live testnet vault predated `migrate_adapter` (added in #464/#507, never on the live contract since — see #514 for the full writeup, including how `.github/workflows/verify-contract-addresses.yml`'s bytecode check caught it).

**Pre-cutover status, at the time this PR was opened:** the old vault below held `get_total_assets() = 200000000000` (20,000 USDC) in outstanding testnet deposits. If you hold a position there, **withdraw before this PR merges** — once merged, the app and `KNOWN_POOLS`/`CONTRACT_ADDRESSES` point at the new vault, and the old one is no longer reachable through the UI (though it keeps working, see below).

**Old vault (superseded):**

| Field               | Value                                                      |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Vault contract      | `CBQYEHWIRJWIPWCJFQZAOP3VAZHRWFGAUS5GZHWFDDYKMFHJ5S3YS2Q5` |
| mUSDC (share token) | `CBC5G4HXTOOZHTBCJQACZB3NJ636JHA5NEBQX5Q265QZN6XEG4LVZ5SB` |
| mUSDC issuer        | `GDZX7DOZMVEZJSWPDIZCTSCAKW4LBB3UGNWYAG5YTCBL4JPMUPAWWEUD` |
| Admin               | `GDZX7DOZMVEZJSWPDIZCTSCAKW4LBB3UGNWYAG5YTCBL4JPMUPAWWEUD` |

This contract is not deleted or disabled — Soroban has no such operation, it keeps running exactly as deployed. `withdraw()` still works on it for anyone who already holds shares there:

```bash
stellar contract invoke --network testnet --source <your-key> \
  --id CBQYEHWIRJWIPWCJFQZAOP3VAZHRWFGAUS5GZHWFDDYKMFHJ5S3YS2Q5 \
  -- withdraw --caller <your-address> --shares <amount>
```

There is no automatic migration or sweep of old positions into the new vault — moving a position across a cutover is a manual withdraw-then-redeposit, not something the vault or its keepers do for you.

**New vault (current):**

| Field               | Value                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Its secret is currently held by this PR's author; rotate it via `set_admin` (no redeploy required) if maintainers want a different durable key in control long-term. |

Verified against #514's acceptance criteria before opening this PR: `migrate_adapter` is present in the deployed vault's function list (`stellar contract invoke ... -- --help`), `vault.get_adapter()` resolves to the Blend adapter above, and that adapter's `get_pool()`/`get_protocol()` resolve correctly — the same chain "Verifying the deployment" above walks through. Also confirmed the deployed vault's on-chain bytecode hash byte-for-byte against a from-source rebuild done on GitHub Actions itself (not a local machine — see the note below on why that distinction matters), matching what `.github/workflows/verify-contract-addresses.yml`'s "Verify On-Chain Bytecode" job independently rebuilds and checks.

**A note on reproducible builds:** `stellar contract build`'s WASM output is not guaranteed byte-identical across different `stellar-cli`/Rust toolchain versions, even from identical source — a newer `stellar-cli` can apply a different (or newly-default) optimization pass and pull in different `soroban-sdk` transitive versions, changing the compiled bytecode. `.github/workflows/verify-contract-addresses.yml` always rebuilds with whatever `stellar-cli` version `cargo install --locked stellar-cli` resolves to _at CI run time_, not a pinned version. If your local `stellar-cli` has drifted behind that (check with `stellar --version` against the [latest release](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-cli/releases)), a contract you deploy locally can genuinely mismatch what CI rebuilds and compares it against, independent of whether your source is correct. If in doubt, verify the WASM you're about to deploy was built with a `stellar-cli` at least as new as CI's, or build it in a CI job of your own (e.g. a throwaway `workflow_dispatch` job that uploads the built `.wasm` as an artifact) and deploy that exact artifact instead of a locally-built one.

## Run the signing flow end-to-end

With the contracts deployed and `known-pools.ts`/`constants.ts` updated:

1. Open the app, connect Freighter (testnet mode).
2. Enter a USDC amount and click **Deposit**.
3. Freighter displays the transaction details; verify the contract address matches `VAULT_CONTRACT_ID`.
4. Approve the transaction.
5. After ~5 seconds, the position summary updates with your deposited amount.
